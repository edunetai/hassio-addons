This addon creates a proxy to a Smarteyes server run separately from EDUNet dashboard so that you can have the benefit of access in the sidebar without running Smarteyes as an addon.

Note that this addon does not run Smarteyes itself.

## Configuration

### Option: `server`

The `server` option sets the address of the Smarteyes server.

This must be in the format `host:port`. The following are valid examples:

- `smarteyes.local:5000`
- `172.16.0.101:5000`

## Required Dependencies
- Network access to running Smarteyes server

## Support
Please [open an issue](https://github.com/edunetai/smarteyes/issues/new/choose) if you need support.
