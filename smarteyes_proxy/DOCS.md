This addon creates a proxy to a Smarteye server run separately from Home Assistant so that you can have the benefit of access in the sidebar without running Smarteye as an addon.

Note that this addon does not run Smarteye itself.

## Configuration

### Option: `server`

The `server` option sets the address of the Smarteye server.

This must be in the format `host:port`. The following are valid examples:

- `smarteye.local:5000`
- `172.16.0.101:5000`

## Required Dependencies
- Network access to running Smarteye server

## Support
Please [open an issue](https://github.com/edunetai/smarteye/issues/new/choose) if you need support.
