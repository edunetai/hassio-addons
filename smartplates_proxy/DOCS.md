This addon creates a proxy to a Smartplates server run separately from Ednunet dashboard so that you can have the benefit of access in the sidebar without running Smartplates as an addon.

Note that this addon does not run Smartplates itself.

## Configuration

### Option: `server`

The `server` option sets the address of the Smarteye server.

This must be in the format `host:port`. The following are valid examples:

- `smartplates.local:6000`
- `172.16.0.101:6000`

## Required Dependencies
- Network access to running Smartplates server

## Support
Please [open an issue](https://github.com/edunetai/smartplates/issues/new/choose) if you need support.
